# Problem statement

Currently, I have stock recommendations, pros and cons, and other information about the company that is supplied by the AI service. The issue is that the user may have further questions given that context. We need to add a UI treatment to the stock details page saying ask a question. Where the user can ask a question about that stock and in the background we add most recent mover and the user transaction history to the user prompt and show them the results.

# Requirements

1. Create a button next to the company name with a lightbulb icon
2. When that button is clicked open a modal with an input textbox a submit button and an area for the answer
3. Add another function to ai-service that makes a request to grok meeting the requiements above
